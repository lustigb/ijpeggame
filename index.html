  <h3>How to Play</h3>
  <p>The goal is to fill all the initially black holes on the board with as few pegs as possible</p>
  <p>Click on a black hole to place a new peg.</p>
  <p>If there is a yellow border around a peg then that is the current active peg.</p>
  <p>Click the "Left" button to fill in any 8 immediately surrounding holes </p>
  <p>Click the "Right" button to fill all empty holes in the same row and column until a blank space (red dot indicates right twist)</p>
  <p>Click on an already active peg (yellow border) again to remove it, which will also revert any holes it filled.</p>
  <p>The big challenge is to complete each puzzle with the minimum number of pegs! </p>



  <p>Enjoy!</p>
